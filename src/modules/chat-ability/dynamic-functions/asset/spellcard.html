  ðŸ§ª The dynamic function ability allows you to create simple TypeScript
  functions using <b>GPT-4</b> that are then stored and accessed when you ask
  similar questions, the OOB database includes 35+ generated function to solve
  common math problems, something small LLMs are terrible at. To use the skill
  just append the ðŸ§ª the question and <b>GPT-4</b> will try to generate a
  function to solve the problem instead of the language model handling it.
