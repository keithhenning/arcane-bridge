  LLM Explorer provides the tools to interact with Large Language Models in way
  that make it easy to design prompts for use with both local and API driven
  models. It also provides a interface for interacting with models with a raw
  completion interface where the user has 100% control over what goes into the
  model.

<p class="mt-4"><u>Saved Sets</u></p>
<p>
  With the LLM explorer you can save input/output pair sets with any number of
  turns. Input/output pairs can also be marked as "excluded" so they are not
  passed to the LLM marking it easy to store and test complex prompt chains
  across multiple models.
