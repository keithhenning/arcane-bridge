Then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance.\n\nWhen Boq saw her silver shoes he said, “You must be a great sorceress.”\n\n“Why?” asked the girl.\n\n“Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch. Besides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses wear white.”\n\n“My dress is blue and white checked,” said Dorothy, smoothing out the wrinkles in it.\n\n“It is kind of you to wear that,” said Boq. “Blue is the color of the Munchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly witch.”\n\nDorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to think her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land.\n\nWhen she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house, where he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made of blue cloth, and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with Toto curled up on the blue rug beside her.\n\nShe ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played with Toto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused Dorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people, for they had never seen a dog before.\n\n“How far is it to the Emerald City?” the girl asked.\n\n“I do not know,” answered Boq gravely, “for I have never been there. It is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business with him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take you many days. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass through rough and dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey.”\n\nThis worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz could help her get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn back.\n\nShe bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of yellow brick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn.\n\nDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its back.\n\nWhile Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the Scarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the scarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.\n\n“Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.\n\n“Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder.\n\n“Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow. “How do you do?”\n\n“I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely. “How do you do?”\n\n“I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile, “for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.”\n\n“Can’t you get down?” asked Dorothy.\n\n“No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away the pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.”\n\nDorothy reached up both arms"

This officer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box, and then he politely opened the gate for our friends.\n\n“Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?” asked Dorothy.\n\n“There is no road,” answered the Guardian of the Gates. “No one ever wishes to go that way.”\n\n“How, then, are we to find her?” inquired the girl.\n\n“That will be easy,” replied the man, “for when she knows you are in the country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her slaves.”\n\n“Perhaps not,” said the Scarecrow, “for we mean to destroy her.”\n\n“Oh, that is different,” said the Guardian of the Gates. “No one has ever destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves of you, as she has of the rest. But take care; for she is wicked and fierce, and may not allow you to destroy her. Keep to the West, where the sun sets, and you cannot fail to find her.”\n\nThey thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West, walking over fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups. Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace, but now, to her surprise, she found it was no longer green, but pure white. The ribbon around Toto’s neck had also lost its green color and was as white as Dorothy’s dress.\n\nThe Emerald City was soon left far behind. As they advanced the ground became rougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the West, and the ground was untilled.\n\nIn the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no trees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.\n\nNow the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as powerful as a telescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she sat in the door of her castle, she happened to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep, with her friends all about her. They were a long distance off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to find them in her country; so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around her neck.\n\nAt once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves. They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.\n\n“Go to those people,” said the Witch, “and tear them to pieces.”\n\n“Are you not going to make them your slaves?” asked the leader of the wolves.\n\n“No,” she answered, “one is of tin, and one of straw; one is a girl and another a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them into small pieces.”\n\n“Very well,” said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed, followed by the others.\n\nIt was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves coming.\n\n“This is my fight,” said the Woodman, “so get behind me and I will meet them as they come.”\n\nHe seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of the wolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf’s head from its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could raise his axe another wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp edge of the Tin Woodman’s weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty times a wolf was killed, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman.\n\nThen he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, “It was a good fight, friend.”\n\nThey waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning. The little girl was quite frightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the Tin Woodman told her all. She thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast, after which they started again upon their journey.\n\nNow"
