  <br /><br />
  The AI assistant application leverages large language models like Llama to
  engage in dynamic and contextually rich conversations. Users can ask
  questions, seek information, or request the model to perform text-based tasks
  such as writing, editing, or brainstorming ideas. The model can comprehend the
  input query and generate responses in natural language, making the interaction
  smooth and user-friendly. In addition to accessing LLMs, the primary advantage
  of using Spell Book over a vanilla LLM chat client is its function calling and
  model routing abilities. To take advantage of these, two models are required
  to be running: <b style="color: blue">Llama 7B (ExLlama)</b> and
  <b style="color: blue">T5 Large v2</b>. These two models are used in
  conjunction with two Loras to provide the function calling services for Spell
  Book. To start these models, go to the <a href="/#/servers">Servers</a> tab
  and follow these directions. <br /><br />

  for instructions on installing and running the models needed for chat
  abilities to function. <b>Step #1: Download Models</b><br />
  Models can be downloaded via the UI on each backend server that is running.
  Start by navigating to Servers > golem-xxxxxx > Available Skills > Embedding.
  You will need to download both T5 Large v2 and Llama 7B (ExLlama) for routing
  to work; they are highlighted by the UI to make them easier to find. T5 is
  found under embeddings, and Llama 7B is found under Language Models. Download
  any other models you are interested in using; if you do not see the model you
  want to use, it can be added with the Custom Skill button.

  /><br />
  <b>Step #2: Run Models</b><br />
  Once the models have finished downloading, they will appear in the Servers >
  golem-xxxxxx > Installed Skills area. They can be run by clicking on the icon
  on the far right that looks like a computer screen.

<h5>Shortcuts</h5>
<p>
  Shortcuts allow you to access chat abilities and language models when
  automatic routing is not sending the request to the correct model or chat
  ability. Shortcuts are emojis that are prepended to a chat request. There are
  also several pre-defined shortcuts to control the context that is sent to the
  model. If function and skill pinning are turned on, manual selection also
  extends the routing definitions, so similar requests will be routed to the
  chat ability or language model automatically. Below are some examples of how
  to use shortcuts.
</p>
<h6>Chat Ability Shortcuts</h6>
<p>
  Each chat ability can be accessed with the shortcut emoji that appears at the
  beginning of its definition. This emoji also appears below the selected skill
  icon in the chat session.
  <br /><br />
  <b>Example:</b> üåû What is the current temp in Chicago?<br />
  <img width="50%" src="{{base_url}}asset/spellbook/prompt/install-5.png" />
</p>
<h6>Skill Shortcuts</h6>
<p>
  You can also access language models with a shortcut. The emoji that represents
  which language model a request can be sent to is found at the beginning of its
  name in the Online Skills section of the
  <a href="/#/servers">Servers</a> configuration. This emoji is also output in
  the chat session in the left-hand column under the circular icon. <br /><br />
  <b>Example:</b> ‚ö° How do I open port 9000 on a Linux box?<br />
  <img width="50%" src="{{base_url}}asset/spellbook/prompt/install-4.png" />
</p>
<h6>Context Limit Shortcuts</h6>
<p>
  You can also control the number of past messages that are sent to the language
  model by using the üëâ and üëÜ emojis. This is useful if only a small part of
  the conversation is relevant to the next chat round and you are trying to save
  money on API calls to OpenAI. In the two examples below, the first will send
  only the one message to GPT-4. The second example sends the last 5
  user/assistant responses to GPT-3.5.<br /><br />
  <b>Example:</b> üëâ‚ú® What is wrong with this code block? ...<br />
  <b>Example:</b> üëÜ5Ô∏è‚É£‚ö° Summarize our conversation so far.
</p>
<h6>Chat Ability and Skill Pinning</h6>
<p class="mb-6">
  The Chat Ability and Skill pinning is functionality that allows the user to
  extend the definitions for routing. When pinning is enabled and a manual route
  is selected with an emoji, the function calling system will save the
  definition of the guessed function or knowledge domain to the database. Future
  similar chat requests will automatically be routed based on these extended
  definitions, making the function calling features work better with more use
  and manually selecting routes.<br />

</p>
<h5>Custom Skills/Models</h5>
<p>
  You can define your own models to be used by the various chat abilities on the
  <a href="/#/servers">Servers</a> page. Click on the Add Skill button. The most
  important fields are explained below. For the most part, you can copy and
  paste an existing definition and change a few key fields.<br />
  <img
    width="50%"
    src="{{base_url}}asset/spellbook/prompt/install-6.png"
  /><br />
  <b>Label</b> Must be unique.<br />
  <b>Routing Key</b> Must be unique.<br />
  <b>Moe Domain</b> Definitions for model routing.<br />
  <b>Moe Function</b> Definitions for model routing.<br />
  <b>Model > Name</b> The last part of the HuggingFace URL for the model
  repository.<br />
